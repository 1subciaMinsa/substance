Welcome to the Substances Guides!

To make the most out of the guides, you should have a working knowledge of:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript - the building blocks of web pages. You can find documentation of each of these technologies at the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web).

- ES2015 modules - Substance is built as a collection of ES2015 modules. You will better understand Substance's project structure and import paths if you are comfortable with [ES6 JavaScript Modules](http://jsmodules.io/).

- ES2015 syntax - Substance takes advantage of the newer language features such as classes, arrow functions, template strings, destructuring, and more. Read [Understanding ECMAScript 6](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read) online.
